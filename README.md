Design a Piplelined CPU using VHDL 98 in ModelSim by describing various components for the CPU
•	Behaviorally and Structurally define components such as Adders, Moore and Booth Multipliers, Moore FSM, Register File, and ALU to    implement and test a Pipelined CPU with ModelSim using exhaustive Testbenches
•	The goal of the class was to derive a solution for the Pipeline CPU that would be better, faster and cheaper than market alternative.


TO RUN THIS PROJECT:
Save program.txt (included) to a prefered location and change file path in the file TB_PROC16 under the component Processor16.
Simulate TB_PROC16 using preferred simulator.

Results:
Processor finished the program described in "program.txt" in 44 ns with a generous clock cycle of 100 ps.
Best Case CC - 50 ps --> Finish Time - 40 ns

More detailed analysis and design details found in "16-Bit Processor Design Analysis.pdf"
